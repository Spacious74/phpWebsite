            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                The Food Server Foundation is an NGO in India headquartered in Bengaluru. Our organisation strives to
                eliminate classroom hunger by implementing the Mid-Day Meal Scheme in the government schools and
                government-aided schools.
                <br> <br>
                Since 2000, Food Server has been concerting all its efforts towards providing fresh and nutritious
                meals to children on every single school day. We are continuously leveraging technology to multiply our
                reach. The state-of-the-art kitchens have become a subject of study and have attracted curious visitors
                from around the world.
                <br> <br>
                Today, Food Server is the worldâ€™s largest (not-for-profit run) Mid-Day Meal Programme serving
                wholesome food every school day to over 1.8 million children from 19,039 schools across 13 states & 1
                Union territory of India.

                On 28 November 2001, the Supreme Court of India passed a mandate, "Cooked mid-day meal is to be provided in
                all the Government and Government-aided primary schools in all the states." And, Food Server was also
                called upon to provide testimonies to the Supreme Court.
                <br><br>
                By the time the Ministry of Human Resource Development - Department of School Health and Education extended
                its support to the initiative in 2003, Akshaya Patra was already reaching out to 23,000 children.
                <br><br>
                Today, Food Server has 58 kitchens spread across 13 states & 1 Union territories of India, a result of the
                successful partnership with the Government of India, various State Governments and generous supporters
